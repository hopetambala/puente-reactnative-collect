Puente will keep your forms private, unless you agree to make your forms publicly available.

We will notify you of any such deal and outline your choices.\n\nWe may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time, and will post the most current version on our website. If a revision meaningfully reduces your rights, we will notify you.\n\n\nContact\nHave questions or concerns about Puente, our Services and privacy?
